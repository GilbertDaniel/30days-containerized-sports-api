# üèÄ Game Day Schedule API  

Welcome to the **Game Day Schedule API**, a containerized sports application that provides real-time schedules and updates for game days. This project was built as part of a DevOps Challenge, showcasing how AWS services can be utilized to deploy and scale modern APIs with reliability and high availability.

## üñ•Ô∏è **Architecture Overview**

![Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/ifeanyiro9/containerized-sports-api/blob/main/architecture.png)

The architecture is built using the following components:

1. **API Gateway**: Manages incoming requests and routes them securely to the backend.
2. **Elastic Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributes traffic evenly across multiple instances of the Sports API.
3. **Amazon ECS**: Orchestrates Docker containers running the Sports API.
4. **SERP API Backend**: Fetches real-time sports data and serves it to users.
5. **IAM Roles and Policies**: Ensures secure access between services with least privilege principles.
